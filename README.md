Hi, I’m @jalex929. You can call me Jay (he/they)!<br><br>
I’m interested in software development and UX Design. I am an activist, and I am passionate about helping people. Some topics I follow closely are those pertaining to the LGBTQ+ community, racial equity, educational reform, and anything relating to the environment.<br><br>
I’m currently learning Python, Java, and JavaScript. I have been expanding my toolkit, making it a point to try out new products and software to help my UX/graphic design/programming journey along. I have also been getting into robotics and trying to up my chess game.<br><br>
I’m looking to collaborate on shipping some products! I'm especially looking forward to gaining experience on teams, where I can collaborate with others and work through the design and development process.<br><br>
